    \end{tabular}
    \caption{System Architecture Design}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Technical Design Decisions}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Password Configuration}
Both attack systems now support on-the-fly password configuration:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Administrator sets target password during server startup
    \item Known password server displays target's personal information
    \item Password patterns generated based on provided personal data
    \item Real-time intelligence gathering simulation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Raw Socket Implementation}
Both attack types utilize raw socket programming to demonstrate packet-level network analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete TCP/IP header construction
    \item Checksum calculation and validation
    \item Packet timing and sequencing analysis
    \item HTTP protocol simulation over raw sockets
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attack Differentiation Strategy}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Dictionary Attack} & \textbf{Known Password Attack} \\
\hline
Volume & High (100+ attempts/min) & Low (20-30 attempts/session) \\
Timing & Fast (0.05-0.2s delays) & Human-like (0.5-2.0s delays) \\
Intelligence & None & OSINT-based personal data \\
Detection & Easy (high volume) & Difficult (targeted, low volume) \\
Success Rate & High vs weak passwords & High vs personal passwords \\
Target & Generic admin account & John Smith profile \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Attack Methodology Comparison}
\end{table}

The design incorporates ethical boundaries and educational focus:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Localhost-only operation by default
    \item Educational disclaimer in all components
    \item Comprehensive logging for analysis purposes
    \item No persistence or data exfiltration capabilities
    \item Clear documentation of defensive applications
\end{itemize}

% 3. Implementation and Demonstration (60%)
\section{Implementation and Successful Demonstration}

\subsection{Dictionary Attack Implementation}

\subsubsection{Attack Steps and Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Server Setup}: Administrator configures target password on startup
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: Load 5,530+ password dictionary from wordlist.txt
    \item \textbf{Target Setup}: Configure target server (127.0.0.1:8080)
    \item \textbf{Packet Construction}: Build TCP/IP packets with HTTP POST payloads
    \item \textbf{Attack Execution}: Sequential password attempts with timing analysis
    \item \textbf{Response Analysis}: Parse HTTP responses for success/failure indicators
    \item \textbf{Logging}: Generate comprehensive attack logs with packet details
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Password Configuration}

The victim server now prompts for password configuration:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Dynamic Password Setup]
Enter target username (default: admin): admin
Enter target password: MySecretPass123!
[*] User configured: admin:MySecretPass123!
[+] Authentication server started on 127.0.0.1:8080
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Attack Execution and Success}

The dictionary attack achieves successful password compromise through systematic brute force:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Key Implementation Functions]
def send_attack_packet(self, username, password):
    """Send attack with detailed packet logging"""
    # Build HTTP POST request
    data = urlencode({'username': username, 'password': password})
    
    # Construct TCP/IP headers
    tcp_header = self.build_tcp_header(...)
    ip_header = self.build_ip_header(...)
    
    # Send packet and analyze response
    response = self.send_packet(ip_header + tcp_header + http_payload)
    
    # Parse success/failure from HTTP response
    if "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" in response and "SUCCESS" in response:
        return True
    return False
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Known Password Attack Implementation}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Target Configuration}

The known password attack focuses on John Smith with configurable password:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=John Smith Profile Configuration]
Target Profile: John Smith
Birth Year: 1985
Pet Name: Buddy
Hometown: Boston
Favorite Team: Patriots
Company: TechCorp

Enter John Smith's password: John1985!
[*] Password set for john.smith: John1985!
[*] Pattern: FirstName + BirthYear + Special
[+] Known Password Attack Server started on 127.0.0.1:8081
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{OSINT Intelligence Gathering}

The attacker automatically displays John Smith's personal information:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=OSINT Intelligence Display]
[*] Gathering intelligence on target: john.smith
[+] Intelligence gathered successfully!
    Full Name: John Smith
    Birth Year: 1985
    Pet Name: Buddy
    Hometown: Boston
    Favorite Team: Patriots
    Company: TechCorp
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Pattern Generation Algorithm}

The attack generates 20+ password patterns based on John Smith's information:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Password Pattern Generation]
def generate_personalized_passwords(self):
    """Generate password candidates based on John Smith's intelligence"""
    patterns = []
    
    # John Smith's information
    first_name = "John"
    birth_year = "1985"
    birth_year_short = "85"
    pet_name = "Buddy"
    hometown = "Boston"
    favorite_team = "Patriots"
    company = "TechCorp"
    
    # Pattern 1: FirstName + BirthYear + Special
    for special in ['!', '@', '#', '$', '*']:
        patterns.append(f"{first_name}{birth_year}{special}")
    
    # Pattern 2: PetName + CurrentYear
    patterns.append(f"{pet_name}2024")
    
    # Pattern 3: Hometown + BirthYear + Special
    patterns.append(f"{hometown}{birth_year}!")
    
    # ... 17 additional patterns based on John's data
    
    return list(set(patterns))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Attack Success Analysis}

\subsubsection{Dictionary Attack Results}

\textbf{Success Rate}: 100\% against weak passwords in dictionary\\
\textbf{Time to Success}: 2-5 minutes average for common passwords\\

% 5. Countermeasure Design and Implementation (Bonus 10%)
\section{Defense Mechanisms and Countermeasures}

\subsection{Implemented Countermeasures}

\subsubsection{1. Rate Limiting System}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Rate Limiting Implementation]
def check_rate_limit(self, client_ip):
    """Check if client exceeds rate limit"""
    current_time = time.time()
    
    if client_ip not in self.rate_limit_tracker:
        self.rate_limit_tracker[client_ip] = []
    
    # Remove old attempts (older than 1 minute)
    self.rate_limit_tracker[client_ip] = [
        attempt_time for attempt_time in self.rate_limit_tracker[client_ip]
        if current_time - attempt_time < 60
    ]
    
    # Check if rate limit exceeded
    if len(self.rate_limit_tracker[client_ip]) >= self.MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_MINUTE:
        return False  # Rate limited
    
    self.rate_limit_tracker[client_ip].append(current_time)
    return True  # Within limits
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Effectiveness against Dictionary Attacks}: High - Successfully blocks high-volume attacks\\
\textbf{Effectiveness against OSINT Attacks}: Low - Human-like timing bypasses rate limits

\subsubsection{2. Pattern Analysis System}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Pattern Detection Implementation]
def analyze_password_patterns(self, username, password):
    """Detect personal information usage in passwords"""
    if username == "john.smith":
        detected_patterns = []
        
        # John Smith's personal information
        if "john" in password.lower():
            detected_patterns.append('FirstName')
        if "1985" in password:
            detected_patterns.append('BirthYear')
        if "buddy" in password.lower():
            detected_patterns.append('PetName')

\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Effectiveness}: High detection of personal information usage in passwords\\
\textbf{Application}: Can trigger additional security measures for suspicious patterns

\subsubsection{3. Behavioral Analysis System}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Behavioral Monitoring]
def analyze_login_behavior(self, client_ip, timing_pattern):
    """Analyze login attempt timing patterns"""
    behavior_score = 0

                            for t in timing_pattern) / len(timing_pattern)
        if timing_variance < 0.01:  # Very regular timing
            behavior_score += 50
    
    # Check for rapid-fire attempts
